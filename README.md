# response-logic-projects
This repository holds various projects that make use of the response-logic approach to infer networks from perturbation response data. To run the scripts you need to install the [response-logic](https://github.com/GrossTor/response-logic) python package. Once installed, simply download this repository and run the scripts with Python 3 as documented in a dedicated README found in each project subfolder. Particularly look into the `toy_model` project to learn how to use the response-logic package.
